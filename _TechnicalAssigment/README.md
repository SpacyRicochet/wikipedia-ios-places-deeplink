# Introduction

This is a technical assignment, where we add a deeplink capability to the Wikipedia iOS app. The deeplink should open the Places tab and move it to the coordinates in the deeplink.
To prove this works, we make another tiny app which fetches a list of locations and allows the user to activate one to open the Wikipedia app at that location.
